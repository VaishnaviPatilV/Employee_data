5. Initial Observations and Potential Insights
High Workload: The average workweek of 49 hours could be a contributing factor to the reported stress levels and the instances of burnout.
Burnout is Rare but Present: With only 2.3% of employees flagged, it would be valuable to analyze this group separately to identify common traits (e.g., specific job roles, experience levels, or work hours that are over-represented).
Diverse Workforce: The company has a good gender balance and a wide range of ages and experience levels, which can be a strength.
